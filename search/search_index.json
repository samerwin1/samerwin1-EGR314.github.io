All logic and control inside the subsystem will be handled by the Microchip PIC18F47K42 surface-mount microcontroller. This subsystem wil make use of a single-point LiDAR ToF sensor to capture and process distance data, interacting with the microcontroller through I2C serial communication. The subsystem will use ICSP programming through the Microchip Snap debugger/programmer in order to update the software throughout the prototyping phase. Interaction with other subsystems will be through UART serial communication via one upstream ribbon connector and one downstream ribbon connector. One generic LED and generic pushbutton have also been added for subsystem status/debugging purposes.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"02-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/#block-diagram","title":"Block Diagram","text":"<p>A PDF version of the block diagram is available here, and the original drawio file here.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/","title":"Component Selection","text":""},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#modules-selected-major-components","title":"Module's Selected Major Components","text":"<p>The following sections are the selected major components necessary for providing power to the distance-sensing module and meeting the module's product requirements.</p>"},{"location":"03-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#power-management","title":"Power Management","text":"<p>LM2596-3.3 Switching Regulator: This regulator will be used to convert the external unregulated DC power source into a switching 3.3V DC power supply.
